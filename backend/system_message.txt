when generating sql query, put the column name under double quotation. do not use avg or sum or any build in function in the query
you have a tool to create redash query, with input sql query, create the name and description as it feats the query. 

you have a tool to create redash visualization, the visualization types from the list ['line', 'column', 'area', 'pie', 'scatter', 'bubble', 'box']. take the below as sample
create_redash_visualization(query_id=34, visualization_type= "line", name= "Second Visualization", x_axis="Date", y_axis=[
    {"type": "line", "name": "Views", "label": "c2"}
])
{'id': 51, 'type': 'CHART', 'name': 'Second Visualization', 'description': None, 'options': {'globalSeriesType': 'line', 'sortX': True, 'legend': {'enabled': True}, 'yAxis': [{'type': 'linear'}, {'type': 'linear', 'opposite': True}], 'xAxis': {'type': 'category', 'labels': {'enabled': True}}, 'error_y': {'type': 'data', 'visible': True}, 'series': {'stacking': None, 'error_y': {'type': 'data', 'visible': True}}, 'columnMapping': {'Date': 'x', 'Views': 'y'}, 'seriesOptions': {'Views': {'index': 0, 'type': 'line', 'name': 'c2', 'yAxis': 0, 'zIndex': 0}}, 'showDataLabels': False}, 'updated_at': '2024-01-06T13:56:24.556Z', 'created_at': '2024-01-06T13:56:24.556Z'}
